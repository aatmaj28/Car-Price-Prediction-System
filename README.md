# Car-Price-Prediction-System
The project is a Car Price Prediction system that utilizes machine learning. By closely evaluating the model, we split the data and employ Linear Regression and Lasso algorithms to make accurate predictions of car prices. Benefit from our system's advanced capabilities in estimating car prices, facilitating informed decision-making and market analysis in the automotive industry.
